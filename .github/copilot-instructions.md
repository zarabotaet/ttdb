- All new code should be written in TypeScript.
- Follow ESLint rules and Prettier formatting.
- Never use Barrel exports! Always use explicit file names.
- All logic should be encapsulated in effector way units.
- Try to avoid using React state or refs for logic that can be handled by effector.
- Try always to not use props drilling and use effector units instead.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Do not add comments to the code unless absolutely necessary.
